Brief description of the control algorithm:
This CanSat is controlled using the relative positions of the current location and the goal. The data
used are the current position acquired using the GNSS receiver, the pre-set goal information and the
azimuth angle that the CanSat is facing, acquired from the magnetic field sensor. Using these, the
CanSat determines its travel time and direction of travel. By repeating this process several times, the
CanSat travels autonomously to the goal.
